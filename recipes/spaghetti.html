    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>During these productions, it's not uncommon for the host to heap praise on the local offerings, but Stanley Tucci (in
    his new show, Searching for Italy) took this to another level, calling this zucchini pasta dish, "life changing,"
    "unbelievable," and "one of the best things I've ever eaten." I love a good vegetable-based pasta, so I decided to give
    this a try. But there was one small problem: It requires the zucchini to be deep-fried first.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 quart sunflower oil, or as needed</li>
        <li>6 medium green zucchini</li>
        <li>4 ounces spaghetti</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Place sunflower oil in a deep fryer and heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Slice zucchini into 1/8-inch rounds.</li>
        <li>Add some zucchini to the hot oil and deep-fry until lightly browned, 4 to 5 minutes. Transfer to a single layer on paper
        towels to drain and repeat to cook remaining zucchini. Let zucchini cool to room temperature.</li>
        <li>Transfer cooled zucchini to a bowl. Cover and refrigerate, 8 hours to overnight.</li>
    </ol>
